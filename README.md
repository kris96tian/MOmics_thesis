### Abstract

The integration of multi-omics data is becoming a main pillar of modern systems biology, by
providing more comprehensive and universal insights into complex biological processes and
disease mechanisms. Nevertheless, despite all the growing advances in high-throughput technologies and computational methods, there are still crucial challenges that lie in the way of
interpreting integration strategies balancing performance, scalability, usage and biological significance.
The techniques used are multi-omics factor analysis (PCA) and Canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and nonlinear methods, which are multi-omics factor analysis (MOFA +, Mowgli)
and deep learning models like variable autoencoders (VAE) and graph convolutional networks
(GCNs) by comparing them on different metrics like predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, robustness to missing data, interpretability, and their ability to handle diverse datasets
beyond those originally used in their development on publicly available and simulated multiomics datasets.
