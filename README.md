### Abstract

The integration of multi-omics data is becoming a main pillar of modern systems biology, by providing more comprehensive and universal insights into complex biological processes and disease mechanisms, biomarker research and classification. Nevertheless, despite all the growing advances in high-throughput technologies and computational methods, there are still crucial challenges that lie in the way of interpreting integration strategies balancing performance, scalability, usage and biological significance.
The techniques used are linear multi-omics matrix factorization analysis (MOFA+), sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (DIABLO), and non linear deep-learning methods, which incorporate variable autoencoders (VAE) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs), namely MoGCN and MOGONET.
The current available methods are mainly compared on different metrics like predictive accuracy, computational efficiency, robustness to missing data, interpretability, their ability to handle diverse datasets, ease of use and more.
For this thesis were used Glioblastoma cancer multi-omics datasets and Breast Cancer data, as well as some self-simulated datasets.
