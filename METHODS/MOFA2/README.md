## Enrichment

MOFA (Multi-Omics Factor Analysis) identifies latent factors associated with variation in multi-omics data. Enrichment analysis links these factors to known biological processes, pathways, and molecular functions. Below is a factor-wise discussion of the results:

### Factor 2: Ion Homeostasis
**Enriched terms**: Intracellular potassium ion homeostasis, sodium ion export across the plasma membrane, monoatomic ion homeostasis.

#### Biological Relevance
- Ion homeostasis is crucial for cellular functions, including maintaining membrane potential, intracellular signaling, and transport processes.
- Disruption in ion channels and transporters is a hallmark of many cancers, including breast cancer, influencing processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, and migration.

#### Implications
Factor 2 likely captures variation in ion-channel-related genes or proteins, which may be driving differences in tumor microenvironments or cellular stress responses.

### Factor 3: Lipid Metabolism
**Top pathways**: Positive regulation of lipid metabolic processes, ABC transporters in lipid homeostasis.

#### Biological Relevance
- Lipid metabolism is often reprogrammed in cancer cells to support rapid growth, membrane synthesis, and energy production.
- ABC transporters are linked to drug resistance and are involved in lipid transport and efflux mechanisms in tumor cells.

#### Implications
Factor 3 highlights metabolic rewiring in breast cancer, specifically lipid catabolism and regulation.

### Factor 4: Calcium Reabsorption
**Top pathway**: Endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption.

#### Biological Relevance
- Calcium signaling is vital for cellular processes like proliferation, migration, and apoptosis.
- Dysregulated calcium homeostasis is a hallmark of metastatic cancers, where it can modulate the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis.

#### Implications
Factor 4 may capture mechanisms related to calcium dynamics in breast cancer progression.

---

### Factor 5: Porphyrin Metabolism
**Top pathways**: Porphyrin metabolism, Metabolism of porphyrins.

#### Biological Relevance
- Porphyrin metabolism is integral to heme synthesis, essential for oxygen transport and cytochrome function.
- Dysregulation of heme metabolism can affect oxidative stress and hypoxia, critical factors in tumor growth.

#### Implications
Porphyrin-related processes might identify tumor subtypes that rely on altered heme synthesis.

---

### Factor 6: GTPase Cycles and Metabolism
**Top pathways**: RND GTPase cycles, Histidine metabolism, Beta-alanine metabolism.

#### Biological Relevance
- Rho-family GTPases (RND1, RND2) regulate cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and invasion, processes critical in metastasis.
- Histidine and beta-alanine metabolism may indicate metabolic dependencies in aggressive tumor phenotypes.

#### Implications
Factor 6 reflects cytoskeletal dynamics and altered metabolism, emphasizing tumor motility and metabolic adaptation.

---

### Factor 8: Multicellular Processes
**Top pathway**: Regulation of multicellular organismal processes.

#### Biological Relevance
- Broad pathways involving intercellular communication, tissue organization, and systemic signaling.
- Likely reflects interactions within the tumor microenvironment, including immune infiltration or stromal remodeling.

---

### Factor 9: Cancer-Specific Signaling
**Top pathways**: Estrogen signaling, Endothelial cell migration, ErbB signaling.

#### Biological Relevance
- These pathways are pivotal in breast cancer, particularly in hormone receptor-positive subtypes (e.g., ER-positive).
- Endothelial migration links to angiogenesis, necessary for tumor vascularization.
- ErbB signaling (including HER2) is a major oncogenic driver in certain breast cancer subtypes.

#### Implications
Factor 9 captures oncogenic signaling and vascularization processes, directly linked to cancer progression and therapy resistance.
