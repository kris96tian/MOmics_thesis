## üß¨ About MOFA+

The app leverages MOFA+ for **integrative analysis** of multi-modal single-cell data. The enrichment analysis feature helps identify biological pathways and processes associated with MOFA factors. To learn more, see:

Argelaguet, R., Arnol, D., Bredikhin, D., et al. **MOFA+: a statistical framework for comprehensive integration of multi-modal single-cell data.** *Genome Biology*, 21, 111 (2020). [DOI:10.1186/s13059-020-02015-1](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-020-02015-1)

## üìä Example Usage

1. Upload your MOFA+ model (.hdf5 file)
2. View basic model metrics and statistics
3. Explore feature weights and correlations
4. Run enrichment analysis on factors of interest
5. Export results for further analysis
