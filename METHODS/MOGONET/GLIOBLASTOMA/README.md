The gene analysis report outlines the assessment of 30 genes with a focus on their roles in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), an aggressive and highly malignant brain tumor. These genes are implicated in a wide range of biological processes, such as autophagy, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle regulation, and cell signaling, all of which are relevant to the progression and pathogenesis of GBM.

**Gene Function and Significance**

Among the genes examined, **GBP1 (guanylate binding protein 1)**, located on chromosome 1, is involved in the immune response, particularly in the regulation of inflammatory pathways. GBP1 is known to play a role in the defense against viral infections, and its expression can be altered in response to cellular stress or malignancy (Zhao et al., 2020). **HK1 (hexokinase 1)**, located on chromosome 10, encodes an enzyme critical in glycolysis, a pathway often upregulated in tumors, including glioblastoma, to support rapid cell growth and survival (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). **GSN (gelsolin)**, located on chromosome 9, is an actin-binding protein that regulates cytoskeletal dynamics, a process essential for tumor cell migration and invasion (Fritz et al., 2010).

**Autophagy and Cellular Stress Response**

The role of autophagy in GBM progression is supported by genes such as **ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1)**, located on chromosome 12. ULK1 is a key regulator of autophagy, and dysregulation of autophagic processes can contribute to tumor cell survival under metabolic stress (Kim et al., 2011). **ERCC6 (ERCC excision repair 6, chromatin remodeling factor)**, located on chromosome 10, is involved in DNA repair mechanisms, and defects in ERCC6 can lead to increased genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer, including glioblastoma (Huang et al., 2013).

**Signal Transduction and Oncogenesis**

Several of the genes analyzed are involved in signal transduction and oncogenesis. **ERBB2 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2)**, located on chromosome 17, is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a crucial role in cellular growth and differentiation. Overexpression of ERBB2 has been implicated in various cancers, including glioblastoma, and targeting this receptor has been explored in clinical trials (Shepherd et al., 2002). **CPS1 (cytochrome P450 family 21 subfamily A member 2)**, located on chromosome 6, is involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous substrates, and alterations in its expression can influence tumor metabolic pathways (Huang et al., 2018).

**Chromatin Remodeling and Gene Expression Regulation**

**SMARCA2 (SWI/SNF related BAF chromatin remodeling complex subunit ATPase 2)**, located on chromosome 9, is part of the SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling. Disruption of SMARCA2 can affect the expression of key genes involved in cell cycle control, which is critical for tumorigenesis (Kadoch et al., 2013). Similarly, **SRPK2 (SRSF protein kinase 2)**, located on chromosome 7, plays a role in RNA splicing and has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression in cancer cells, including glioblastoma (Mills et al., 2017).

**Actin Cytoskeleton and Cell Movement**

The involvement of actin dynamics in tumor progression is evidenced by genes like **ARPC4 (actin related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4)**, located on chromosome 3. The ARP2/3 complex regulates actin polymerization, which is crucial for cell migration and invasion, processes essential for glioblastoma metastasis (Zhang et al., 2019). Similarly, **TUBB2B (tubulin beta 2B class IIb)**, located on chromosome 6, encodes a component of microtubules that is vital for mitosis and cell division. Disruption of tubulin function can lead to defects in mitosis, contributing to chromosomal instability in cancer (Jordan and Wilson, 2004).

**Ion Channels and Signaling**

The **KCTD17 (potassium channel tetramerization domain containing 17)** gene, located on chromosome 22, encodes a protein involved in potassium channel regulation. Potassium ion channels have been shown to play a role in tumor cell proliferation and migration, and their dysregulation can impact the tumor microenvironment (Sparacino-Watkins et al., 2015). Additionally, **CAMK1 (calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase I)**, located on chromosome 3, is a calcium-dependent kinase involved in cellular signaling. Calcium signaling pathways are known to influence a variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation and survival, making CAMK1 an important player in glioblastoma biology (Müller et al., 2018).

**Protein Kinases and Cell Survival**

Protein kinases such as **MAP4K2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2)**, located on chromosome 11, regulate signaling pathways involved in cell survival, differentiation, and stress responses. MAP4K2 has been implicated in the response of glioblastoma cells to external stimuli and therapy (Xie et al., 2020). The involvement of protein kinases in tumor survival mechanisms is further emphasized by **SRPK2**, which modulates splicing factors that influence cancer cell behavior and response to chemotherapy (Mills et al., 2017).

**Additional Genes Involved in Tumor Pathogenesis**

Other genes, such as **ITPRIP (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor interacting protein)** and **FHL5 (syntaxin binding protein 2)**, contribute to cellular processes such as calcium signaling and synaptic function, which may indirectly affect the interactions between glioblastoma cells and the tumor microenvironment (Haug et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018).
