### Enrichment Analysis Results

#### Hormonal Regulation and Reproductive Processes

The **progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation** and **oocyte meiosis** pathways were significantly enriched through genes *PGR* (progesterone receptor) and *CPEB2*. These findings underscore the importance of hormonal regulation in cellular differentiation, which is frequently dysregulated in breast cancer. *PGR* has been shown to modulate breast cancer growth through its role as a transcription factor in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer subtypes【1】. *CPEB2* is linked to translational regulation and may influence tumor progression indirectly【2】.

The **estrogen signaling pathway**, enriched by *PGR* and *ESR1* (estrogen receptor 1), emphasizes the critical role of estrogen receptor signaling in breast cancer. Estrogen receptor signaling drives cell proliferation and survival in hormone receptor-positive breast cancers and is a primary target of therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors【3】【4】.

#### Breast Cancer Pathway

The enrichment of the **breast cancer pathway**, involving *PGR* and *ESR1*, directly aligns with the known biology of breast cancer. These genes are implicated in tumor growth, therapy resistance, and prognosis【3】【5】.

#### Metabolic Pathways

The **nitrogen metabolism** pathway, enriched by *CA12* (carbonic anhydrase 12), reflects metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer. *CA12* contributes to pH regulation in the tumor microenvironment, aiding cancer cell adaptation to hypoxia and promoting tumorigenesis【6】. Similarly, the **fatty acid degradation** and **valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation** pathways, enriched by *ACADSB* (acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short/branched chain), indicate altered lipid and amino acid metabolism. Such changes are characteristic of cancer cells adapting to increased energy demands【7】.

#### Cancer Signaling Pathways

Pathways such as **chemical carcinogenesis**, **pathways in cancer**, and **proteoglycans in cancer**, enriched by *PGR*, *ESR1*, and *IL6ST* (interleukin 6 signal transducer), highlight the interplay between hormone signaling, inflammation, and extracellular matrix remodeling in cancer progression【8】【9】.

#### Immune and Cytokine-Related Pathways

The enrichment of immune-related pathways, including **JAK-STAT signaling**, **cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction**, and **viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor**, underscores the role of inflammation in breast cancer. *IL6ST* mediates IL-6 signaling, which is associated with tumor-associated inflammation, immune evasion, and metastasis【10】【11】.

#### Neurological and Neurodegenerative Pathways

The enrichment of pathways such as **Parkinson disease**, **Alzheimer disease**, and **amyotrophic lateral sclerosis**, driven by *XBP1* (X-box binding protein 1), suggests a link between cancer and neurodegenerative processes. *XBP1* is a transcription factor activated during endoplasmic reticulum stress, a condition commonly observed in both cancer and neurodegenerative diseases【12】【13】.

#### Hormonal and Hedgehog Signaling

Pathways like **thyroid hormone signaling**, **prolactin signaling**, and **Hedgehog signaling** were also enriched, highlighting additional layers of hormonal regulation in breast cancer biology. *SCUBE2*, enriched in the Hedgehog pathway, has been associated with tumor suppression and improved prognosis in breast cancer patients【14】【15】.

### Statistical and Methodological Considerations

The adjusted p-values control for false discovery rates, ensuring statistical robustness. The combined score, which integrates p-value and effect size, highlights the pathways with the strongest associations, such as **nitrogen metabolism** and **progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation**.
